# CS-300
course assignments for SNHU CS 300

* **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**<br><br>
The objectives for the projects completed in this course were to create code that would open, read, and parse course information from a .txt file, take that data and add it to the data structure of our choice, and then write code that searches and displays the resulting structure. I chose to use a binary search tree in my code.<br><br>
* **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**<br><br>
I first had to determine which data structure was the best fit for this program. I had to consider the runtime analysis of each algorithm in addition to determining which would be easiest to code.<br><br>
* **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**<br><br>
My roadblocks came in the form of family health issues and stress at work. Unfortunately, I got behind in my classwork and I never managed to fully catch up. However, I kept at it and sought help from a tutoring service. <br><br>
* **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**<br><br>
Learning more about runtime analysis was eye-opening to see how long some algorithms are. I have a better understanding of the importance of choosing the right data structure for the project.<br><br>
* **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br><br>
I think I still need work here. I should have broken up my code into separate classes and headers more.
